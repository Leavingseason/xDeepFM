# xDeepFM

Source code for our KDD 2018 paper:
eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM) https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170.

As stated previously, we are developing an opensource deep learning based factorization toolkit and all mentioned models will be released in a suitable way and time.
Currently we only release the source code of xDeepFM model for reference.
Some early works can be found here:

Update 2018-07-26:
Some readers meet some troubles when running the source code.
I have just updated the codebase, comment some lines which are not use in xDeepFM model, and also upload a data sample.
Now you can run the code simply through `python main.py`. 

Update 2018-10-29:
Before running the code, you should run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the package dependencies.
